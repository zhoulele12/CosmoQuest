# Web 3.0
## Key Concepts
1. Decentralization
2. Blockchain
3. Tokenization

## Opportunity 
1. Be the company that builds the **infrastructure** of the new Internet. Basically the next Google.

## Challenge
1. Centralized databases are faster, more power-efficient.
2. **Scalability** of decentralized databases seems to be a perpetual issue.
3. Decentralized currency seems to be the only application of the blockchain.
4. 投机>投资>使用.

## How does blockchain work? 
- Basically a **decentralized database** implemented as a **linked-list of blocks**.
- Each block contain 1. prev hash 2. data 3. nonce. 
- With these things together, we calculate a new hash as the identity of this block. Hash changes when anything inside a block changes.
- Every node(computer) in the network has the same copy of the blockchain (a user might not be a node).

怎么管理？

Transactions happen at different times -> conflicts -> To reach agreements -> need a consensus mechanism 

If different copies of valid chains exist -> majority wins 

Only need to check the hash of the last block to verify equality 

Proof of work ->  longest wins + majority wins 

A consensus mechanism  

Need to solve a math problem before adding a block -> hard to solve, easy for (others) to verify 

Mining is the act of adding blocks to the chain -> miners compete for the right to add a block -> rewarded with coin (cuz they keep the network secure) -> block broadcasted to the entire network (verified by others) -> updated the state of the chain (if the majority thinks your solution is fraud -> rejected) 

If two miners mined a block at the same time(unlikely) ->  both broadcast their chains and keep working on the next block -> other people accepts the longest of all chains-> however, both get rewarded 

Attack -> if I change a block in the middle -> all calculated hash change-> had to recalculate nonce for all subsequent blocks to make your version of the chain valid -> must be faster than everyone else 

tokenization -> digitized ownership -> intermediaries eliminated -> efficiency  

Token -> digital asset 

Contribute computing power, get tokens 

Perform actions -> need to pay -> crypto 

Can choose to sell data -> tech giants have already completed their initial capital accumulation process 

Smart contracts 

Stored on blockchains

Fungible 1 equals 1 e.g. rmb 

NFT 1 !=1 e.g. houses.each token represent sth different .

1.0 static, read only, like reading magazines, but on a screen 

2.0 read-and-write, interactive 

3.0 token owners own part of the Internet  


共产主义理想 - 生产资料公有化？ 

not really 

digital assets are not the entirety of someone’s assets -> and people don’t work for digital assets.  

servers are owned and operated by a third party still 

Is data a means of production?  

Ponzi scheme?
